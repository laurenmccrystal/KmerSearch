Welcome to the README.md script for this Kmer Search code!

My name is Lauren McCrystal, and I was tasked to with developing Python code to analyze DNA sequences, specifically by searching for k-mer sequences. Each set of code that you will find in this repository is commented and therefore it should be easily reproducable. 

There will be a couple of different files in this repository! In the **K-mer.py file**, you can see how an example DNA sequence was taken and tested to verify that it outputs all k-mers using the function list_kmers. Additionally, this code was further manipulated to output unique kmers in the example DNA sequnce which is defined as the function unique_list_kmers. In this unique list of kmers from the example data, I also includes a list of unique subsequent kmers because genome assembly is constructed utilizing kmer substrings. 

Another file that you will find in this repository us called **ReadingFileKmer.py**. This code reads a specific file (reads.fa) containing DNA sequences. The following code was developed to identify all possible kmers, and additionally all possible subsequent kmers.
